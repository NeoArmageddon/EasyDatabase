VERSION
	returns DLL version
	@return STRING ?
INIT
	initializes the DLL
	Will take care that it is only callen once
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
INITIALIZED
	checks if DLL is initialized
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
GETLASTERROR
	returns error of last function call (usually set when a function returns false,
	please raise a bug if you ever find a function that does not sets the error!)
	(or EMPTY string if error message was toolong to be transfered)
	@return STRING ?
OPEN
	creates a new connection
	if no timeout is given, you NEED TO take care that it is closed BEFORE a mission change!
	when timeout is provided (>0), the DLL will start a new thread in background that checks
	if the last call > timeout (checks periodicly, timeout is not precise)
	@ARG 1 SCALAR connection timeout in seconds
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
KEEPOPEN
	Resets optional auto-close timer of the OPEN function
	Will return "FALSE" if connection is closed and thus can be used to check the connection state
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
CLOSE
	closes an existing connection
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
CREATESTMT
	Creates a new SQL statement
	@return ARRAY ["TRUE":STRING, <STMT ID>:SCALAR] | ["FALSE", -1:STRING]
QUERY
	executes a query statement and prepares query receive functions (everything that returns data is a query,
	example: SELECT, SHOW)
	please note that you cannot do anything else with the dll before you did not queried the FULL string or cleared!
	@ARG 1 SCALAR operating STMT ID
	@ARG 2 STRING Query to execute
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
UPDATE
	executes an update statement (everything that does not returns data is an update,
	example: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, CREATE)
	!IMPORTANT!
	You need to take care that INSIDE of strings your quote char (") is escaped propper! (\")
	The DLL wont take care that this things happen
	Also make sure that you dont try to use datatypes that will not be the same when you would do the following in sqf:
	compile str [<DATA>];
	@ARG 1 SCALAR operating STMT ID
	@ARG 2 STRING Update to execute
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
CLOSESTMT
	Closes an existing SQL statement
	@ARG 1 SCALAR operating STMT ID
	@return STRING "TRUE" | "FALSE"
NEXT
	returns next
	empty string is returned when there is nothing left to print out
	@ARG 1 SCALAR operating STMT ID
	@return STRING ? | ""
CLEAR
	clears current query buffer
	@ARG 1 SCALAR operating STMT ID
	@return STRING "TRUE"
